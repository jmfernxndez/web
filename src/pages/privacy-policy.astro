    <section class="data-collection">
      <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        My projects, including Webtracker and Web Vitals, are designed with
        privacy in mind. Below is how data is handled:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Webtracker</strong>: This Chrome extension tracks the time you
          spend on websites entirely offline. No data is collected, stored, or
          transmitted to external servers. All tracking data (e.g., time spent
          per domain) is stored locally on your device and is accessible only to
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Web Vitals</strong>: This extension, maintained by
          jmfernxndez, collects performance metrics (e.g., LCP, CLS, INP)
          locally within your browser. No personal data is collected or sent
          externally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Personal Data</strong>: Neither extension collects personal
          information such as names, email addresses, or browsing history beyond
          what is necessary for their core functionality.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="data-storage">
      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        All data generated by my extensions is stored locally on your device
        using browser storage (e.g., localStorage for Webtracker). No cloud
        storage or external servers are used, ensuring your data remains private
        and secure. I do not have access to any data generated by these
        extensions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="third-parties">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        My extensions do not use third-party services for data collection,
        analytics, or tracking. They operate independently within your browser,
        ensuring no data is shared with external entities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="user-rights">
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Since my extensions do not collect or store personal data externally,
        there is no need for data access or deletion requests. You can manage or
        clear local data by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Uninstalling the extension via <code>chrome://extensions/</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Clearing your browserâ€™s local storage through browser settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
